# Java Calculator Project

This project demonstrates a simple menu-driven calculator that supports basic arithmetic operations, square root, power, mean, and variance calculations.


## Calculator

The `Calculator` class contains methods for performing various arithmetic operations.

### Methods

- `add(double a, double b)`: Returns the sum of two numbers.
- `subtract(double a, double b)`: Returns the difference between two numbers.
- `multiply(double a, double b)`: Returns the product of two numbers.
- `divide(double a, double b)`: Returns the quotient of two numbers.
- `sqrt(double a)`: Returns the square root of a number.
- `power(double a, double b)`: Returns the result of raising a number to the power of another.
- `mean(double[] numbers)`: Calculates the mean of an array of numbers.
- `variance(double[] numbers)`: Calculates the variance of an array of numbers.

## MainClass

Serves as the driver for the calculator, presenting a menu to the user and handling their input to perform calculations.

### Functionality

- The user is presented with a menu of operations.
- The user selects an operation to perform.
- The program then prompts the user for the necessary inputs and displays the result.

## Usage

To compile the project, navigate to the directory containing the source files and run:
